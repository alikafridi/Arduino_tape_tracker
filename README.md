Arduino_tape_tracker
====================

This code allows an arduino to help a car navigate a track using 5 analog light sensors on the car. It was a part of my final project 

The attached report explains design decisions and the project in more detail. 

The diagram below explains the wiring of the sensors and the Current-Amplifier (CA) modules.
